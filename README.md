# Differentiable Categorisation

This repository contains a framework for optimizing analysis categories in a differentiable way using TensorFlow. It is designed to be both general and configurable, and can be adapted for specific HEP analyses such as the ttH vs. tH optimization.

## Project Structure

- `diffcat_optimizer/`: Contains the core Python modules.
- `examples/`: Example scripts for toy data and a specialized ttH-tH analysis.
- `setup.py`: Script for installing the package (optional).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
